#six types of cancer classification

#project overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning-based classification system capable of accurately identifying six types of cancers:brain cancer,breast cancer,lung and colon cancer,cervical cancer,oral cancer,and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.utilizing advanced deep learning models,this system contributes to the field of cancer diagnosis and research.

## Project Objectives
- Build a robust classification model to differentiate between six types of cancers.
- Utilize the provided dataset to train and evaluate the models.
- Implement evaluation metrics such as accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report to assess model performance.
- Develop a user-friendly deployment solution to make the trained models accessible for predictions.

- Flask
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- NumPy


## Dataset
The project employs a comprehensive cancer classification dataset sourced from [Kaggle](insert_dataset_link). This dataset contains a diverse collection of medical images representing different cancer types.

## Models Used
1. *VGG16*: A classic architecture known for its strong performance in image classification tasks.
2. *MobileNetV2*: A lightweight neural network suitable for efficient deployment on resource-constrained environments.
